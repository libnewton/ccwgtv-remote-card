Chromecast with Google TV Remote Card (CCwGTVRemoteCard) is a custom web component designed to act as a virtual remote control for Google TV. It integrates with Home Assistant to control Chromecast with Google TV devices, allowing you to navigate the interface, adjust the volume, and launch apps like YouTube and Netflix.

This component leverages the Home Assistant Android TV Remote integration for seamless control of your Google TV or Android TV device.

## Prerequisites
Before you can use the Chromecast with Google TV Remote Card (CCwGTVRemoteCard), you need to set up the Android TV Remote integration in Home Assistant:

Set up the Home Assistant Android TV Remote Integration https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/androidtv_remote/. 

This integration allows you to control Android TV or Google TV devices via Home Assistant. Follow the official documentation to configure the integration.

Ensure your Chromecast with Google TV is properly integrated and working in Home Assistant, with the ability to send commands like up, down, select, volume_up, and others.

  ```
10. Restart Home Assistant to apply the changes.

### 2. Manual Installation
1. Download the latest release from the Releases page **https://github.com/schilea/ccwgtv-remote-card**.
2. Place the **.js** file in your Home Assistant **www/community/cwgtv-remote-card** folder.
3. Add the following to your **lovelace** resources in the **configuration.yaml** file:
  ```yaml
resources:
  - url: /www/community/cwgtv-remote-card/ccwgtv-remote-card.js
    type: module
  ```
### Configure the Remote Card
Once the card is installed, add it to your **Lovelace** dashboard by creating a custom card with the following configuration:

#### Add the Custom Card to Your Dashboard
- **Edit the Dashboard**: Go to Overview and click the three dots in the top right corner, then select Edit Dashboard.
- **Add a Custom Card**: Click the **Add Card** button (the "+" symbol). Scroll at the bottom to find **Custom cards** and select **Custom: CCwGTV Remote Card**.

- Alternatively you can **Add a Manual Card**: Click the **Add Card** button (the "+" symbol). Scroll to find **Manual card** and select it.
  Configure the Manual Card: in the YAML editor that appears, add the following configuration:
  ```yaml
  type: 'custom:ccwgtv-remote-card'
  ```
#### Add or modify the Configuration Options
- **title**: The title of the card.
- **scale**: Adjust the size of the remote (default: 0.87, range: 0.5 to 1.5).
- **Button Mappings**: Define the action for each button using the Home Assistant domain, service, and service_data.

#### Available Buttons
- **D-Pad**: up, down, left, right, select
- **Control Buttons**: back, home, assistant, volume_up, volume_mute, volume_down, youtube, netflix
- **Bottom Buttons**: power, star

`star` is rendered as the Google TV Streamer favorites button. For existing configurations, the card still accepts `input` as a fallback mapping for that button position.

#### How to Use
Add the card to your Lovelace dashboard with the necessary button mappings.
The component will render a Google TV remote control.
Clicking on a button triggers the corresponding action in your Home Assistant instance.

#### Example of Lovelace Custom Card
```yaml
type: custom:ccwgtv-remote-card
title: Google TV Streamer Remote
scale: 1.5
up:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: DPAD_UP

  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: DPAD_DOWN
left:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: DPAD_LEFT
right:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: DPAD_RIGHT
select:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: DPAD_CENTER
back:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: BACK

  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: SEARCH
home:
  domain: remote

  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: HOME

  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.ccwgtv
    command: MUTE

#### Limitations

1. **ASSISTANT** button on this custom remote card will open Chromecast **SEARCH** menu, similar as pressing **search** button on Chromecast Voice Remote.

2. There is no mapping in Android TV Remote for the Google TV Streamer **STAR** button. Instead, the above configuration uses a media_player command to switch to source LiveTV on the corresponding TV entity where Chromecast is connected.
   
Depending on TV vendor, commands from TV official integration can be used.

LG WebOS integration https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/webostv/ example for calling button commands **EXIT** or **MENU**:
```yaml
star:
  domain: webostv
  service: button
  service_data:
    entity_id: media_player.media_player.living_room_tv
    button: EXIT
```
3. **VOLUME** buttons (MUTE, UP, DOWN) are working only if the Chromecast **Volume Control** is set to Chromecast (Chromecast > **All Settings** > **Remotes & Accessories** > **Set up remote buttons** > **Volume control** > **Chromecast** ).
   
5. If the Chromecast **Volume Control** is set to a different option (like **TV IR**), commands are not working with TV, but you can set the **VOLUME** buttons **UP** and **DOWN** to control directly the TV via media_player command. Not valid for **MUTE** where media_player command works only if curent state is known.
```yaml
volume_down:
  domain: media_player
  service: volume_down
  service_data:
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
volume_up:
  domain: media_player
  service:  volume_up
  service_data:
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
```
6. Alternativelly, commands for TV official integration can be used.
   
LG WebOS integration https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/webostv/ example for calling button commands **MUTE**, **VOLUMEDOWN**, **VOLUMEUP**:
```yaml
volume_mute:
  domain: webostv
  service: button
  service_data:
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
    button: MUTE
volume_down:
  domain: webostv
  service: button
  service_data:
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
    button: VOLUMEDOWN
volume_up:
  domain: webostv
  service: button
  service_data:
    entity_id: media_player.living_room_tv
    button: VOLUMEUP
```
Samsung TV integration https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/samsungtv/ example for calling button commands **MUTE**, **VOLUMEDOWN**, **VOLUMEUP**:
```yaml
volume_mute:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.samsungtv
    command: KEY_MUTE
volume_down:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.samsungtv
    command: KEY_VOLDOWN
volume_up:
  domain: remote
  service: send_command
  service_data:
    entity_id: remote.samsungtv
    command: KEY_VOLUP
```
